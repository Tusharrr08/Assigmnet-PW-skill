    "Different Method used for Web Scrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML parsing: This is the most basic method of web scraping, and it involves parsing the HTML code of a web page to extract the desired data. This method is relatively simple to implement, but it can be difficult to extract data from complex or dynamic web pages.\n",
    "DOM parsing: This method is a more advanced form of HTML parsing, and it involves using the Document Object Model (DOM) to extract data from a web page. The DOM is a hierarchical representation of the HTML code of a web page, and it makes it easier to extract specific elements of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Many websites offer APIs that allow you to access their data programmatically. This is a very efficient way to extract data from websites, as it eliminates the need to parse the HTML code. However, not all websites offer APIs, and the APIs that are available may not provide access to all of the data that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser automation: This method involves using a browser automation tool, such as Selenium or Puppeteer, to interact with a web page and extract data. This method is very powerful, as it allows you to do things like click buttons, fill out forms, and scroll through pages. However, it can also be the most complex method of web scraping, and it requires some programming knowledge."

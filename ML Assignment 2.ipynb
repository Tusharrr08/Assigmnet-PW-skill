    "Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, and as a result, it becomes too specific to the training data and does not generalize well to new data. Underfitting occurs when a model does not learn the training data well enough, and as a result, it is unable to make accurate predictions on new data.\n",

    "Consequences of overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor performance on new data: A model that is overfit will perform poorly on new data that it has not seen before. This is because the model has learned the training data too well, and as a result, it has become too specific to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced accuracy: Overfitting can also lead to reduced accuracy on the training data. This is because the model is learning the noise and randomness in the training data, which can lead to inaccurate predictions.\n",

    "Consequences of underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor performance on both new and training data: A model that is underfit will perform poorly on both new and training data. This is because the model has not learned the training data well enough, and as a result, it is unable to make accurate predictions on either new or training data.\n",

    "Reduced accuracy: Underfitting can also lead to reduced accuracy on the training data. This is because the model is not learning the patterns in the training data well enough, which can lead to inaccurate predictions.\n",

    "Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to increase the size of the training data. This can help to prevent overfitting by providing the model with more data to learn from. For example, if you are training a model to classify images of cats, you could augment the data by rotating, flipping, or cropping the images. This will create new variations of the images, which will help the model to learn more about the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

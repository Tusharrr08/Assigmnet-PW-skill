You collect data on the color of a car and the number of accidents that the car has been involved in. You then want to calculate the mean number of accidents for each color of car. However, you cannot do this because the color of a car is a nominal variable.

Therefore, you cannot calculate the mean number of accidents for each color of car.\n",
